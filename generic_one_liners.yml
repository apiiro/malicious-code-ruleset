    message: Minified, compressed, obfuscated or any other form of unreadable files is excluded from the scan, because although a strong indicator of maliciousness, its FP rate is relatively higher. It is highly recommended to store such files in CDN, cloud buckets, etc. and keep the codebase readable.
